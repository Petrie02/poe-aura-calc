# Quick-and-Dirty Aura effect calc for Auramancers.

[Go here to see it in action](https://aura.poe.farm)

This is a basic, web-based program to let you see the stats your aurabot will give to a build.

It supports all aura gem levels, and each gem can be combined with a Generosity support of any level.

The web page generates a block of stats that can be copied & pasted into Path of Building, 
to let you share and preview the overall effect on another player's build.

The link it generates in the nav bar can also be shared, in order to share your stats with others.
