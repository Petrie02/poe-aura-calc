[Go here to see it in action](https://shadowmoose.github.io/poe-aura-calc/src/)

This is just a basic, very quickly-written, web-based program to let you see stats your aurabot will give to your build.

It supports all aura gem levels, and each gem can be combined with a Generosity support of any level.

The link it generates in the nav bar can be shared, in order to share your stats with others.
